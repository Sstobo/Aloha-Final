# Aloha Project
 
Sean Stobo presents Aloha, in Grid! October 2-16, 2017

## Learnings

The big take away from this project, for me, is the importance of organization and clarity of purpose in my code. With the large amount of styling, and no use of sass, it was very important for me to comment and organize my code. Also, looking back on this project, I am much better now at targeting specific elements and using more specificity in my CSS and HTML

### Challenges

I decided to use grid for the overall page layout. This created several challenges, as there are fewer resources for grid than flex or more traditional layouts. This gave me many opportunities to learn and create new techniques for styling.

### Take aways

I have learned the importance of planning layout, rather than just diving in. I have also learned how valuable Sass functionality is, as nesting and mixins make my code much more readable, and efficient.
